# AI CLI Prompt Templates

Professional collection of refined prompt templates for AI command-line tools.

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for any outcomes resulting from the use of these prompt templates. Users assume all risks and responsibilities for:

- Any system modifications, file changes, or commands executed
- Data loss, corruption, or unintended consequences
- Security implications of running AI-generated commands
- Compatibility issues with specific environments or setups
- Performance impacts on systems or applications

These templates are provided "as-is" for educational and productivity purposes. Since everything is in natural language, I encourage you to **review and modify any command** to fit your specific needs before testing.

Always:
- Review commands before execution
- Test in safe environments first
- Maintain adequate backups
- Understand the implications of each operation
- Customize templates for your particular use case

Use at your own discretion and risk.

## What is this?

Modern LLMs with agentic capabilities allow us to command the terminal through structured, natural language instructions. These prompt templates provide comprehensive workflows that guide AI assistants through complex procedures with clear objectives.

Unlike simple one-line prompts, these templates offer complete, battle-tested workflows for specific purposes.

## Key Features

Based on my template structure, you'll find:

- **Complete Metadata** - Name, version, description, and localization
- **Structured Workflows** - Phased execution with clear progression
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Recovery procedures and validation
- **Integrated Documentation** - Built-in guidance and examples
- **Security Considerations** - Safety measures and best practices
- **Backup Management** - Version control and rollback capabilities
- **Validation Requirements** - Pre-execution checks and tool verification

## AI is Your Co-pilot

These templates represent the collaborative effort between human expertise and AI assistance. Creating effective prompts requires:

- Clear understanding of your objectives
- Multiple iterations and testing
- Detailed explanations of workflows
- Continuous refinement based on results

While AI accelerates development, it demands precise communication and structured thinking to achieve desired outcomes.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

1. Copy `.toml` files from any category to your CLI config directory:
   - `~/.qwen/commands/` (Qwen CLI)
   - `~/.gemini/commands/` (Gemini CLI)

2. Restart your CLI and press `/` to discover new commands

3. Execute templates directly:
```bash
qwen document-code
gemini analyze-data
